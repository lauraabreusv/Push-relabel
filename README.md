# Push-relabel

Push-relabel algorithm computes maximum flows on a flow network using the operations Push and Relabel. It does that in O(VÂ²E) 
which is an improvement if comparing it to other classical maximum flow algorithms. 

This code was written to an assignment of a class on Graph Theory (UFMG-2019).
